# Advent of Code 2023

Link of the challenge: https://adventofcode.com/

## Organization

Since we will be several at doing the challenge, I propose we use the following code structure:

- at the top level, a directory per day (`01`, `02`, ...)
- in each "day directory", a directory per user, based on your Github handle (`rivten`, ...). In this directory, you are free to do whatever you want!

```
├── 01
│   ├── rivten
│   │   ├── day01.cpp
│   │   └── input.txt
│   ├── johndoe
│   │   └── foo
│   │       ├── bar
│   │       ├── baz
```

Of course, you are free to participate whenever you wish to do so. Don't feel forced to anything.
